# An interface element which allows visitors to view all of the files in the dataset curves
# directory, along with descriptions and file histories extracted from Git.
#
# Note that each group has "type: files", which instructs ETLocal to treat this section differently
# to other elements. This must be present.
#
# "paths" is an array of glob patters, matching files which will be shown to the user when visiting
# this section of ETLocal. Paths are relative to the dataset directory. For example, "curves/*.csv"
# will match all CSV files in the datasets/{dataset_id}/curves directory (but not subdirectories).
# You may name individial files and use recursive matching ("curves/**/*.csv").
#
# "*"     - Matches any file. Can be restricted by other values in the glob.
# "c*"    - Matches all files beginning with "c".
# "*c*"   - Matches all files that have a "c" in them.
# "**"    - Matches directories recursively.
# "?"     - Matches any one character.
# "[set]" - Matches any one character in a set.
# "{p,q}" - Matches either a "p" or "q".
# "\"     - Escapes the next metacharacter.
#
# See the documentation for Dir.glob for more information on how glob patterns work:
# https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Dir.html#method-c-glob
