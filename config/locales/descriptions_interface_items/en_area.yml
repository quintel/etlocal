        This value is used to determine the potential for coastal wind turbines.

        This value determines the maximum area available for wind turbines on land and ground mounted
        solar PV plants.

        The required length for distribution pipelines for district heating varies with the number of 
        connections. It makes sense to first to connect densely populated neighborhoods 
        where fewer meters of pipeline are needed per connection than in less densely populated 
        neighborhoods. The ETM takes this into account by calculating five 'steps' in average 
        lengths per connection. The more houses that are connected, the higher the average length 
        per connection. Here you can indicate the average pipe length with which the ETM calculates 
        if (up to) 20% of the houses and buildings are connected.
