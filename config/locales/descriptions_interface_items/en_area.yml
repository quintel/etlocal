      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_first_bracket: |
        The required length for distribution pipelines for district heating varies with the number of
        connections. It makes sense to first to connect densely populated neighborhoods
        where fewer meters of pipeline are needed per connection than in less densely populated
        neighborhoods. The ETM takes this into account by calculating five 'steps' in average
        lengths per connection. The more houses that are connected, the higher the average length
        per connection. Here you can indicate the average pipe length with which the ETM calculates
        if (up to) 20% of the houses and buildings are connected.
