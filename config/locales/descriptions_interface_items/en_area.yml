      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_first_bracket: |
        The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of
        connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating
        networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less
        densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average
        pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher
        the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of
        the distribution pipelines when (up to) 20% of houses and buildings are connected to the
        network.

        the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of
        the distribution pipelines when (up to) 40% of houses and buildings are connected to the
        network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_third_bracket: |
        The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of
        connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating
        networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less
        densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average
        pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher
        the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of
        the distribution pipelines when (up to) 60% of houses and buildings are connected to the
        network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_fourth_bracket: |
        The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of
        connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating
        networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less

        the distribution pipelines when (up to) 80% of houses and buildings are connected to the
        network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_fifth_bracket: |
        The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of
        connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating
        networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less
        densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average
        pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher
        the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of
        the distribution pipelines when (up to) 100% of houses and buildings are connected to the
        network.
      heat_length_of_connection_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_first_bracket: |
        The ETM distinguishes between distribution pipelines and 'connection' pipelines. Connection
        pipelines are the pipelines from street level to front door. The average length of
        connection pipelines varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely
        populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower
        average connection pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM
        takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average connection pipeline lengths. The
        more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection
        typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the connection pipelines when
        (up to) 20% of houses are connected to the network.
