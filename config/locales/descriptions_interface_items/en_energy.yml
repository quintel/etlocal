        This setting is only relevant if a waste-to-energy plant is present in this area. This
        setting allows you to specify how sustainable the burnt waste is: What share of waste is
        biogenic (organic waste, wood or paper) and what share is non-biogenic (plastics etc.)?
        The more non-biogenic waste is burnt the more CO2 emissions waste incineration brings about
        and the fewer sustainable energy is produced.
