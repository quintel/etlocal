      energy_power_sector_own_use_electricity_demand: |
        Own use of electricity in the energy sector. For example, electricity used for cooling of power plants, pumping stations etc.
      energy_power_hv_network_loss_demand: |

      energy_distribution_greengas_demand: |
        The amount of green gas blended into the gas network. This excludes direct use of biogas (for example local production used as CHP fuel).
      energy_greengas_gasification_dry_biomass_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by gasification of dry biomass?
      energy_greengas_gasification_wet_biomass_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by gasification of wet biomass?
      energy_greengas_upgrade_biogas_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by fermentation of biomass?
      energy_distribution_biogenic_waste_energy_distribution_waste_mix_child_share: |
        This setting is only relevant if a waste-to-energy plant is present in this area. This
        setting allows you to specify how sustainable the burnt waste is: What share of waste is
        biogenic (organic waste, wood or paper) and what share is non-biogenic (plastics etc.)?
        The more non-biogenic waste is burnt the more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions waste incineration brings about
        and the fewer sustainable energy is produced.
      energy_production_dry_biomass_max_demand: |
        The potential for dry biomass production in this area. Dry biomass includes: residual streams from forestry (tree tops, stumps, bark, branches), recycled waste wood, residual streams from agriculture (straw), and fast-growing bio-energy crops (elephant grass, willow, poplar). See the

      energy_production_oily_biomass_max_demand: |
        The potential for oil-containing biomass production in this area. oil-containing biomass includes: rapeseed, sunflower seeds, oil palm, used frying fats. See the

        The amount of electricity produced by geothermal power plants. This is a new technology that has not (yet) been deployed at a large scale.
      energy_heat_distribution_loss_demand: |
        Losses due to transmission and distribution of heat in district heating networks. On average, losses are typically 20%+ of annual heating demand.
