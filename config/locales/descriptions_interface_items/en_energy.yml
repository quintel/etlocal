      energy_power_sector_own_use_electricity_demand: |
        Own use of electricity in the energy sector. For example, electricity used for cooling of power plants, pumping stations etc.
      energy_power_hv_network_loss_demand: |
        Grid losses due to transmission and distribution of electricity in this region. On average, this is around 5-8% of total electricity demand.
      energy_distribution_greengas_demand: |
        The amount of green gas blended into the gas network. This excludes direct use of biogas (for example local production used as CHP fuel).
      energy_greengas_gasification_dry_biomass_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by gasification of dry biomass?
      energy_greengas_gasification_wet_biomass_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by gasification of wet biomass?
      energy_greengas_upgrade_biogas_energy_distribution_greengas_child_share: |
        What share of the current green gas demand in this area is produced by fermentation of biomass?
      energy_distribution_biogenic_waste_energy_distribution_waste_mix_child_share: |
        This setting is only relevant if a waste-to-energy plant is present in this area. This
        setting allows you to specify how sustainable the burnt waste is: What share of waste is
        biogenic (organic waste, wood or paper) and what share is non-biogenic (plastics etc.)?
        The more non-biogenic waste is burnt the more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions waste incineration brings about
        and the fewer sustainable energy is produced.

      energy_heat_distribution_ht_loss_demand: |
        Losses due to transmission and distribution of heat in district heating networks. On average, losses are typically 20%+ of annual heating demand.

        What share of total heat production by the chemical sector can potentially be re-used as residual heat? Residual heat can be used in district heating networks to heat homes and other buildings. The Energy Transition Model makes a distinction between residual heat from processes and residual heat from flue gases. The slider below shows what share of total heat production can be recovered as residual heat from processes. More information about industrial residual heat can be found in our
