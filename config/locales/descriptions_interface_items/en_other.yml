        This setting is only relevant if there is a waste incineration plant in
        this area. Here you can see how sustainable the incinerated waste is: What percentage of
        the waste is biogenic (such as organic waste, wood, paper) and how much is non-biogenic (such as plastics)?
        The greater the share of non-biogenic waste, the more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are attributed to
        waste incineration and the less sustainable energy the waste incinerator produces.
