      industry_ICT: |
        Value sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        ICT sector demand is included in the 'final consumption - other sectors - commercial and public services' on the energy balance, but there is no explicit flow.
        An estimate of this demand is therefore made.

        This demand is then moved in <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/blob/master/tools/energy_balance_generator/etm_tools/energy_balance_operations/converters/industry_ict.py" target=\"_blank\"> this script</a> from the commercial and public services to a new sub-sector of the industry, the ICT sector.
      industry_metal: |
        Value sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        Other metals demand is included in the 'final consumption - industry sector - non-ferrous metals' on the energy balance, but there is no explicit flow.

        An estimate of the aluminium demand is therefore made in a source analysis, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/blob/master/tools/energy_balance_generator/etm_tools/source_analysis/non_ferrous_metals_demands.py" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.

        This aluminium demand is then defined as a sub-category of the non-ferrous demand and the remaining demand is categorized as other metals demand in <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/blob/master/tools/energy_balance_generator/etm_tools/energy_balance_operations/converters/industry_metal.py" target=\"_blank\"> this script</a>.

      industry_fertilizer: |
        Value sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        Fertilizer demand is included in the 'final consumption - industry sector - chemical and petrochemical' on the energy balance, but there is no explicit flow.

        An estimate of the fertilizer demand is therefore made in a source analysis, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/blob/master/tools/energy_balance_generator/etm_tools/source_analysis/fertilizer_demands.py" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.

      energy_fossil_electricity_production: |
        The total electricity production per energy carrier is sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        Since the ETM distinguishes several plant types per energy carrier an additional analysis has been done to calculate the production per plant type. This calculation was done based on power plant capacities provided by TenneT.

        These power plants have been added to the "complemented energy balance" that can be found in the link below this message.

        The total electricity production per energy carrier is sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        Since the ETM distinguishes several plant types per energy carrier an additional analysis has been done to calculate the production per plant type. This calculation was done based on renewable capacities from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/cb78d4e5-82c0-4874-963f-fb265ae2025f?lang=en&page=time:2019" target="_blank">this Eurostat table</a>.

      energy_heat_production: |
        The total heat production per energy carrier is sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        A simple analysis has been done to assign the heat production to the district heating technologies available in the ETM, taking into account the heat demand on the two district heating networks that are modelled in het ETM: a residential and industrial heating network.

        The heat plants have been added to the "complemented energy balance" that can be found in the link below this message.

      energy_efficiency: |
        The total electricity and heat production per energy carrier is sourced from the Eurostat energy balance.

        Since the ETM distinguishes several plant types per energy carrier an additional analysis has been done to calculate the production per plant type. This calculation was done based on power plant capacities provided by TenneT.

        These power plants have been added to the "complemented energy balance" that can be found in the link below this message. The efficiencies have been calculated by dividing the electricity or heat output by the fuel input from the energy balance. For other power plants default efficiencies are used.
