      # energy
      energy_distribution_biogenic_waste_energy_distribution_waste_mix_child_share: "This setting is only relevant if a waste-to-energy plant is present in this area. This setting allows you to specify how sustainable the burnt waste is: What share of waste is biogenic (organic waste, wood or paper) and what share is non-biogenic (plastics etc.)? The more non-biogenic waste is burnt the more CO2 emissions waste incineration brings about and the fewer sustainable energy is produced."
