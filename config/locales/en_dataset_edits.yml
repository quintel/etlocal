    explanation:
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_first_bracket: The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the distribution pipelines when (up to) 20% of houses and buildings are connected to the network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_second_bracket: The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the distribution pipelines when (up to) 40% of houses and buildings are connected to the network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_third_bracket: The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the distribution pipelines when (up to) 60% of houses and buildings are connected to the network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_fourth_bracket: The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the distribution pipelines when (up to) 80% of houses and buildings are connected to the network.
      heat_length_of_distribution_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_object_fifth_bracket: The length of distribution pipelines of district heating networks varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average pipeline lengths per connection. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the distribution pipelines when (up to) 100% of houses and buildings are connected to the network.
      heat_length_of_connection_pipelines_in_meter_per_residence_first_bracket: The ETM distinguishes between distribution pipelines and 'connection' pipelines. Connection pipelines are the pipelines from street level to front door. The average length of connection pipelines varies with the number of connected buildings. Typically, densely populated areas are connected to district heating networks first. These areas have a lower average connection pipeline length per connection than less densely populated areas. The ETM takes this into account by using 5 'brackets' of average connection pipeline lengths. The more houses are connected to the network, the higher the average length per connection typically is. Here you can specify the average length of the connection pipelines when (up to) 20% of houses are connected to the network.

      # energy
      energy_distribution_biogenic_waste_energy_distribution_waste_mix_child_share: "This setting is only relevant if a waste-to-energy plant is present in this area. This setting allows you to specify how sustainable the burnt waste is: What share of waste is biogenic (organic waste, wood or paper) and what share is non-biogenic (plastics etc.)? The more non-biogenic waste is burnt the more CO2 emissions waste incineration brings about and the fewer sustainable energy is produced."
