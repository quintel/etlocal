      <strong> Welcome to the ETM Data Manager for Regions! </strong></br>
      With the <a target="_blank" href="https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com/Energy Transition Model">
      Energy Transition Model </a> (ETM) you can explore the future energy system for different
      geographic regions: countries, provinces, municipalities, neighborhoods, etc. The energy system
      is a large and complex entity and in order to map this, sufficient data of good quality must
      be provided for each region to be able to “fill” the ETM. Behind each region in the ETM runs
      an "energy graph" (the calculator of the model in which energy flows, conversion steps and
      relationships are modelled) and this graph only calculates if all the necessary data is
      available.</br>
      This ETM Data Manager provides insight into the regional data and sources behind the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com/Energy Transition Model">
      Energy Transition Model </a>. For an overview of the sources used for Dutch regions, see our
      <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/data-sources-local">
      documentation </a>.</br></br>
      <strong>How does it work? </strong></br>
      In the left bar you will find various topics related to energy demand, energy production and
      general information about the region, such as geography, emissions, infrastructure. Within
      each topic you will find all associated data fields. By clicking on the "i" icon to the left
      of the data field you will find more information about the data that is displayed, which
      sources have been used and whether this number has recently changed.
