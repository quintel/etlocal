      <strong> Welcome! </strong></br></br>
      With the <a target="_blank" href="https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com">
      Energy Transition Model</a> (ETM) you can explore the future energy system for different
      geographic regions: countries, provinces, municipalities, neighborhoods, etc. The energy system
      is a large and complex entity and in order to map this, sufficient data of good quality must
      be provided for each region to be able to "fill" the ETM. Behind each region in the ETM runs
      an 'energy graph' (the calculator of the model in which energy flows, conversion steps and
      relationships are modelled) and this graph only calculates if all the necessary data is
      available. This necessary set of data is often referred to as a 'dataset'.</br></br>
      The ETM Data Manager gives a complete overview of all data and sources used for these datasets. 
      At the moment mostly datasets of regions within a country are included in
      the ETM Data Manager and no country datasets. In the long run all country datasets will also become
      available through the ETM Data Manager.</br></br>
      <strong>How does it work? </strong></br></br>
      Please take the steps below to find the source data for a specific region:</br></br>
      <ol>
      <li>Search for your region in the search bar or by using the map</li>
      <li>Open the dataset</li>
      <li>Check out all source data for your region</li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Adding and updating datasets</strong></br></br>
      The ETM is open source and open acces. Maintaining the datasets takes time and we do it on request. Would you like to have a dataset added or updated? 
      Please, feel free to contact <a href="https://quintel.com/contact" target="_blank">Quintel</a>, the developers of the ETM.</br></br>
      <strong>Questions?</strong></br></br>
