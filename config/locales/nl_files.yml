  # This file contains translations for file and directory names and descriptions.
  #
  # These are used with interface elements whose type is "files", and which have a "paths"
  # attribute. These elements allow visitors to view the history of files in ETSource which cannot
  # be edited in ETLocal.
  #
  # Each path is split into segments. For example, "curves/weather/default/my_curve.csv" is split
  # into four segments, each of which can be localised:
  #
  # - "curves"
  # - "weather"
  # - "default"
  # - "my_curve" (note the lack of a file extension)
  #
  # To localise these segments, add them to the list below with a "name" key:
  #
  #   curves:
  #     name: '' # An empty string will cause the segment to be hidden in the interface.
  #   weather:
  #     name: Weather
  #   default:
  #     name: Default
  #   my_curve;
  #     name: A curve for testing
  #
  # The curve will now be shown in the user interface as:
  #
  #   Weather → Default → A curve for testing
  #
  # Localisations may also have an optional "description". These will be shown alongside a file
  # history, and help inform visitors as to the purpose of a file, its contents, etc. Descriptions
  # may not contain HTML, but multiple newlines may be used to split the description into
  # paragraphs.
  #
  #   my_curve:
  #     name: A curve for testing
  #     description: >
  #       This is a curve used to show how files can be localised.
  #
  #       This is a second paragraph where more information can be added, without hitting the
  #       visitor with a wall of text.
